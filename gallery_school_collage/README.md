# School Collage Images

This folder contains collage images for each school visit. Each image should be named according to the school name to match the entries in `schools-gallery.json`.

## Naming Convention

Name your collage images to match the school name from the JSON file:
- `GHS Phase-5.jpg`
- `GHS Kumbra.jpg`
- `GHS-Saneta.jpg`
- `GHS-Hulka.jpg`

Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`

## Image Guidelines

- **Recommended size**: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality**: Use compressed images for web display
- **Content**: Create a collage showing highlights from each school visit

## How It Works

The gallery page will automatically display these images in a responsive grid. The images are matched to schools by filename (without extension).
